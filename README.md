# AutoEditor

Poor mans line/text editor. Freeware program for automatic text manipulation via masks and counters. INI manipulation, search and replace, filter, open save, browse ... usefull for fast generating of a lot of text.

some special use case for kn5/fbx files, it tries to open them too, it uses included "Kn5Unpack.exe":
if kn5: unpack, if binary fbx, convert to ascii,
then it scan's the resulting ascii fbx and you get a list of Meshes and Materials + existing dds filenames (leaving behind the unpacked stuff, if kn5 ;)).
